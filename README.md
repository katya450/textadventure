# textadventure

A project for myself to get familiar with old school text adventure while learning Java.

I write everything myself, but I get some help from Sarvija1.

The process in this project is that I get small tasks (Specs) which explain what the program should do next and then I implement it in.
As a student, I don't always find the prettiest solution and that's why there's some refactoring during the way :-)
